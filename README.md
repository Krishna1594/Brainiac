# Brainiac
Version: 1.0.0

Creator: Krishna Nischal Bharatula

A Discord Bot specifically developed for the share-market.
This discord bot can define several technical terms involved or currently used in share-market. Most of these definitions are either taken from Wikipedia or personal notes of the 'admin' that incorporates insights and experiences. 
Brainac will respond to few causal expressions such as 'hi', 'how are you Brainiac?" and more expressions of such category will be added soon. It is important to note that all the expressions or commands will begin with "?". For example, typing "?ROCE" under the server will invoke Brainiac to respond with definition of ROCE and similarly others.
The motive behind Brainiac is that, one can have their queries answered readily rather than looking for definitions elsewhere and its fun to have an interactive bot.
